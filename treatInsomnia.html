          <span class="font-semibold">Personal Insight:</span>Choose a Bedtime
          and Wake-Up Time: Select a bedtime and wake-up time that aligns with
          your natural sleep preferences and daily routine. Aim for 7-9 hours of
          sleep per night.Be Consistent Every Day: Try to go to bed and wake up
          at the same time every day, even on weekends. Consistency reinforces
          your body's sleep-wake cycle.Avoid Drastic Changes: Gradually adjust
          your sleep schedule if needed. Shift your bedtime and wake-up time by
          15-30 minutes every few days until you reach your desired schedule.Use
          an Alarm: Set an alarm to remind you when it's time to start winding
          down and prepare for bed. This helps signal your body that sleep is
          approaching.
